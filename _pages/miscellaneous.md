# Rock N Roll Bands
I have a broad taste on the Rock music and get obsessed with lots of famous bands, such as [Meat Puppets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0IWHxvswLk), [Nirvana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax0C6rlo-54), [Pink Floyd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoiSIlE7w6w), [Radiohead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA-5ampZxwQ), [Suede](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vUayJZeiHM)...

# My instruments

I have a Fender Duo-Sonic Electric Guitar(Surf Green) and a Fender CD-60S. They are my best friends, which can give me impetus and inspiration when I feel lost.

# Photography

I equip with a sony a6300 mirrorless camera and several basic lenses (35mm, 18-50mm, 24-105mm). When I was in Xi'an, I occasionally took them out (when i was free) and wandered about the streets, which left me many warm memories.

# Productivity tools

A 2014-Mid Macbook pro with Dual-core i5, 8G RAM and 256GB SSD, which helps me to  complete most of the works.
