I am a 1st-year PhD student in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at University of California, Riverside. I am now working with [Dr. Shaolei Ren](https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~sren/index.html) on sevarel exciting projects! My research focuses on security for Industry IoT. I come from a historic and lovely city - [Nanjing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing). Before joining UC Riverside, I worked in the ISN state key lab in Xidian University, under the supervising of [Dr. Huaxi Gu](http://antl.xidian.edu.cn).
